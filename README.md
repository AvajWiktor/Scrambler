# Scrambler

Hi, this is my scrambler, you can use it to encrypt messages

It creates, a log file in C:/CryptoLogi, when an unauthorized login attempt occurs.

First password is: wesolyborowik69

Second is current day of the week in polish:

monday = poniedzialek

tuesday = wtorek

wednesday = sroda

thursday = czwartek

friday = piatek

saturday = sobota

sunday = niedziela

Then program asks you:
1. Encode message
2. Decode message

Now you have to write your message (it has to be lowercase) or write name of the file with message to decode like "x.txt" (it has to be in same folder as Scrambler.exe)
